    "The exponential distribution can be used as a model for the distribution of times between the occurrence of successive events. Recall that the Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events in an interval of time, where the parameter $\\alpha$ is the expected number of events occurring in 1 unit of time. The distribution of elapsed time between the occurrence of two successive events is exponential. \n",
