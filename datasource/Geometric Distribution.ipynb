    "An urn contains 4 green balls and 5 red. What is the probability that a red ball is drawn on the 8th draw?<br> \n",

    "\n",
    "There is less than a 1 percent chance that the 8th draw is a red ball. In other words, there is a less than 1 percent chance that it will take 7 fails before a success of drawing a red ball. Recall, that the experiment ends once a success has occurred. <br> "
